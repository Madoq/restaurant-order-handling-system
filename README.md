# Restaurant Order Handling System
### What is this Project
It is a small program that handles orders and menus in a restaurant, allows you to add/remove a dish from the menu, save changes to the menu, and allows you to place orders.
### Why something like that
This is a group project for college, we had to do an object oriented program, which includes materials from lectures. in the end, we made a restaurant order management program. This was our first group project in college, and not last.
### Before you start
If you want to add/remove/change a dish, you can do it from within the program, then save the changes, or modify the menu.txt file. Please, remember that the formatting must remain unchanged, otherwise there may be problems with correct reading of the file
